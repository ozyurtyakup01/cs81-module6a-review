What was the hardest part to understand?
usage of this

How does this code use this to tie data and behavior together?
In the code "this" used for new created object. myMix given for test, so "this" holds a reference for myMix or any new object that will be created.

What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?
I would use classes. Also instead of removing an element and setting new first to current, I would simply set current to the next.
